    <h2>INT. LIVING QUARTERS. GALLEY - MOMENTS LATER</h2>
    <p class="des">OLD sits in a heap of trash. He’s wearing only his sweaty,
        baggy, mostly unbuttoned union suit, his vest with his watch
        chain, and his cap.
        He smokes his PIPE...
        It goes out.</p>

    <h2>OLD</h2>
        <p class="talk">Damn.</p>

    <p class="des">He tries to find a match in the chaos.</p>
     
    <h2>OLD (CONT'D) (to himself)</h2>
        <p class="talk">Fiery pit! Ain’t there no justice
            left in this world?</p>

    <p class="des">He roots through the rubbish, throwing it around...
        Suddenly, the sound of a MATCH striking (O.S.)!
        OLD turns around, startled.
        YOUNG is right behind OLD... with a LIT MATCH... utterly
        still. Eerily still.
        He calmly lights OLD’S PIPE.
        OLD feels a bit uneasy.</p>
