    <h1>Pasta Aglio e Olio from "Chef"</h1>
    <h3>Binging with Babish version</h3>
    <p class="p1">Hey guys what's up? I'm back with a bew episode and it's been kind of a long week so I wanted to make something a little quicker a little easier this week.</p>
    <p>And I've always wanted to try that pasta Aglio e Olio from that flirtatious scene in Chef.</p>
    <p>And look at this, it only has six ingredients, perfect.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<div>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 head garlic, separated and peeled</li>
        <li>1/2 cup flat-leaf parsley, rinsed and finely chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 cup good quality olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1/2 pound dry linguine</li>
        <li>1/2 lemon</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
</div>
     
<div>
    <ol>
        <li>So we're gonna start by bringing a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil.</li>
        <li>And while that comes up to a boil, we're gonna peel our <span>garlic</span>. And this is a great little trick. You take all the cloves of garlic and put them in a tupperware and give them a good shake.</li>
    </ol>
</div>

    <p>Like just shake the hell out of it.</p>
    <p>And then, you open up, you have perfectly peeled...oh that didn't really work, did it?</p>
    <p>I -- I guess we're gonna peel these by hand, so get your tools ready. And get to peeling.</p>
    <p>Be sure to use your Scotch as necessary.</p>

<div>
    <ol>
        <li>Now we want to slice all the cloves of garlic very thinly and put them aside while we pick our parsley leaves off their stems.</li>
        <li>Now, we want to get rid of any big thick stems, but smaller ones are ok because we're going to chop this pretty fine.</li>
        <li>So we're gonna chop it up very fine before heading over to the stove and add our pasta at the boiling water</li>
        <li>And add about a 1/2 a cup of olive oil to a large saut√© pan. Once shimmering, we're going to add the garlic...</li>
        <li>And just when you start to see it turning brown, add the red pepper flake, and remove it from the heat.</li>
        <li>The garlic will continue to cook until a nice toasty golden brown, at which point you're gonna add the pasta.</li>
        <li>We're gonna add back some pasta water to help create more of a cohesive sauce before mixing in the parsley.</li>
        <li>A big squeeze of lemon juice...</li>
        <li>And give it one last check for seasoning and hit it with any salt and pepper that it needs...</li>
        <li>Give it a good stir...And then plate it up just like John does with a big carving fork.</li>
        <li>Make a nice little nest like that in the center of the bowl.</li>
    </ol>
</div>

    <p>Now this is an example of a recipe that is greater than the sum of its parts.</p>
    <p>It was absolutely fantastic.</p>
    <p>If you don't believe me, let's hear what I said after my first bite...</p>
    <p>"Mmm...oh <span id="shit">sh*t</span>, that's good...mmm."</p>
    <p>It really was that good.</p>
    <p>The only thing missing was Jon Favreau for me to make sexy eyes at.</p>
